Billy - a 10x10 Othello Board

To run Billy, adapt if necessary the content of billy.sh (for unix/linux platforms)
or of billy.bat (for windows platforms) and then launch this script.

To run Billy on a littlegolem game, run ten.sh (unix/linux) or ten.bat (windows)
with the id of the game as single argument (you may also need to adapt some paths or
to install wget).

For instance:

$> ten 334345

will fetch the game number 334345 from littlegolem and open Billy on it.

Just tell me if you encounter any problem.
